    You have made the do_calculation function above.  Use that here.
    We will do a calculation on the complex number and seed.
    Then take the resulting complex number as the new complex number and
    then do the calculation again with that new complex number and the same
    original seed.
    Keep doing this until EITHER
    (a) the new complex number get more than 2 "units" away from the origin
    OR
    (b) you have iterated 255 times

    When this has completed, return the number of iterations that executed
